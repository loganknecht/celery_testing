# Celery Notes
## Overview

## Tutorial
Celery tutorial here:
http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/getting-started/first-steps-with-celery.html

## Running
### Run RabbitMQ Server
The RabbitMQ server scripts are installed into /usr/local/sbin. This is not automatically added to your path, so you may wish to add
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin to your .bash_profile or .profile. The server can then be started with rabbitmq-server.

All scripts run under your own user account. Sudo is not required.
